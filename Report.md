## 4. Explain the reason(s) responsible for such difference between perceptron and a 3-layer NN by comparing the plots you generated in Steps II and III.
From the pictures above, we can see that the perceptron gives a bad result with about 46% error rate since it can classify data linearly, whereas, the neural network is able to represent any kind of data due to each neuron works separately and combines an output at the end. Hence, the data in circular shape is not an issue for neural network. It can separate data correctly close to 95%, which is considerably more efficient comparing to the perceptron.
